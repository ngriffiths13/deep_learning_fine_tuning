# Fine Tuning and Feature Extraction for Deep Learning

This repo includes notebooks with examples showing how to do transfer learning with both text and image data. It also shows how to effectively tune transfer weights to unique data sets. 

After tuning networks on the dataset from goodreads, I combine tabular data and the features extracted from book covers and book descriptions to make the best genre classifier of all of them.
